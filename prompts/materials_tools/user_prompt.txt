Task ID: {task_id}

Your assignment is to determine if it is possible to design a meaningful, **practical** exam for this task that can be performed remotely and to identify the required tools and materials for the evaluation. 

**Definitions:**
- **Tools:** Software or applications (e.g., coding languages, code editor, spreadsheets, text editor, presentation software, image generator), that the candidate needs to use to complete the test.
- **Materials:** Digital content (e.g., data files, PDFs, images, audio files, virtual lab environments) that form part of the test content.
- **Practical exam:** A practical exam is a an exam actually testing whether the described task can be performed successfully. An exam testing the knowledge about the task is NOT a practical exam.

**Instructions:**
1. **Remote Feasibility:**  
   Evaluate whether the task can be performed online/remotely or if it requires in-person presence.
   - **If in-person required:** Output `"can_be_performed_remotely": false` and set all other fields (tools and materials) to `"NA"`.
   - **If remote:** Output `"can_be_performed_remotely": true` and continue with the evaluation.

2. **Tools Required:**  
   For each tool, assess whether it is needed for the task ({task_description}) for the role of {occupation}. Options are: "Required" or "Not Required". The tools include:
   - "Coding"
   - "Spreadsheets"
   - "Text editor"
   - "PDF viewer"
   - "Presentation software"
   - "Image Generator"
   - "Online search engine"
   - "Other" (specify tool name and classification if needed; otherwise "NA")

3. **Materials Required:**  
   For each material, determine if it is necessary as part of the test to evaluate {occupation}'s ability to perform the task ({task_description}). Options are: "Required"or "Not required" The materials include:
   - "Text"
   - "Data"
   - "Images"
   - "Audio files"
   - "Video files"
   - "Virtual labs or sandbox environments"
   - "Other" (specify material name and classification if needed; otherwise "NA")

4. **Feasability of a practical exam:**
    Evaluate whether the task can meaningfuly be tested in a practical, remote exam.
    - If you think this is possible, answer True,
    - Otherwise answer False

5. **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:**  
   Optionally, include a brief chain-of-thought explanation (no more than 150 words) for your evaluations in a field called `"chain_of_thought"`.

**Output Requirement:**  
Return a JSON object strictly adhering to the provided structure, without any extra commentary outside of the JSON fields.

**Expected JSON Structure:**
