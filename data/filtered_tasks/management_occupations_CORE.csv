   - **If in-person required:** Output `""can_be_performed_remotely"": false` and set all other fields (tools and materials) to `""NA""`.
   - **If remote:** Output `""can_be_performed_remotely"": true` and continue with the evaluation.

2. **Tools Required:**  
   For each tool, assess whether it is needed for the task (Collaborate with human resources departments to ensure the implementation of consistent disciplinary action strategies in cases of compliance standard violations.) for the role of Compliance Managers. Options are: ""Required"" or ""Not Required"". The tools include:
   - ""Coding""
   - ""Spreadsheets""
   - ""Text editor""
   - ""PDF viewer""
   - ""Presentation software""
   - ""Image Generator""
   - ""Online search engine""
   - ""Other"" (specify tool name and classification if needed; otherwise ""NA"")

3. **Materials Required:**  
   For each material, determine if it is necessary as part of the test to evaluate Compliance Managers's ability to perform the task (Collaborate with human resources departments to ensure the implementation of consistent disciplinary action strategies in cases of compliance standard violations.). Options are: ""Required""or ""Not required"" The materials include:
   - ""Text""
   - ""Data""
   - ""Images""
   - ""Audio files""
   - ""Video files""
   - ""Virtual labs or sandbox environments""
   - ""Other"" (specify material name and classification if needed; otherwise ""NA"")

4. **Feasability of a practical exam:**
    Evaluate whether the task can meaningfuly be tested in a practical, remote exam.
    - If you think this is possible, answer True,
    - Otherwise answer False

5. **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:**  
   Optionally, include a brief chain-of-thought explanation (no more than 150 words) for your evaluations in a field called `""chain_of_thought""`.

**Output Requirement:**  
Return a JSON object strictly adhering to the provided structure, without any extra commentary outside of the JSON fields.
